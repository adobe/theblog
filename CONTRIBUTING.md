# Contributing to The Adobe Blog

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Adobe Blog (The Blog). As an Open Development project, The Blog is not just open to contributions, but we actively encourage and seek contributions from across Adobe. **We are thrilled to have you on board.**

## How to contribute to The Blog

For each of the Open Source projects, refer to the project's `CONTRIBUTING.md`. For Project Helix:

1. Create a GitHub issue for stuff that you want to work on, even if it's just an idea
2. Open Pull Requests for code changes
3. Make sure your code is tested and covered by CircleCI

A good start point is to check the issue tagged with ["good first issue"](https://github.com/search?q=is:open+repo:%22adobe/the-blog+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&type=Issues).
