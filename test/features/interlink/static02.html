  <p>That’s precisely the question that we posed to marketing, IT, and other executives, all of whom are on the hook for <a href="https://www.adobe.com/experience-cloud/customer-experience-management.html">customer experience management</a> in some shape or form in the year ahead.</p>

  <p>For customer experience, it’s not just about marketing, analytics, advertising, content, commerce, or CRM lead management. It’s about all of them. Great experiences are great differentiators. And there’s only one company that’s a leader in everything you need to deliver them.</p>

  <p>Their responses below highlight the need for organizations to fine-tune their <a href="https://www.adobe.com/events/experience-makers-live/2020/build-a-customer-experience-management-foundation.html">customer experience strategy</a> to ensure it lives up to the expectations of consumers who are now living in a digital economy, mostly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To meet the needs of increasingly digital consumers in 2021, organizations will need to build omnichannel customer experiences that use advanced technologies for customer intelligence, automation, personalization, and contextual relevance to serve the right experience to the right customer at the right time.</p>
